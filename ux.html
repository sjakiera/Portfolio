							<h1>UX/UI Design</h1>
							<p> UX/UI design is my forte, and I am passionate about the art of crafting digital experiences tailored to users' needs. I thrive on conducting research and gaining insights into user behaviors, as understanding users is paramount in creating meaningful designs. In the realm of digital design, I view UX/UI as more than a crucial aspect—it is the very foundation that shapes and enhances the user's journey.</p>

                            <p>Welcome to Let’s Work, a dynamic platform designed to revolutionize the way students discover part-time job opportunities and employers connect with vibrant talent. In this individual final assignment, we delve into shaping the information architecture and user experience (UX/UI) design of Let’s Work.</p>

                                <h3>Flowchart</h3>
<p>The flowchart lays out the steps, choices, and exceptions guiding employers through the recruitment process on the vacancy website. It includes subscription options, showcasing the user's journey when choosing between different plans. Additionally, it highlights what happens when a candidate is deemed suitable for a job or not. </p>

								</div>

								<h3>Results</h3>
								<p>I've successfully developed a versatile vacancy website catering to both employers and potential employees. Both parties can log in, with a distinct login page for employers accessible directly from the homepage. The wireframes are crafted from the perspective of a future employee seeking a job.</p>
<ul>
	<Li><h3>Extra Functionality - Homepage Vacancies:</h3><p>In response to user preferences revealed in the journey map, the homepage now showcases relevant vacancies. Users can sort these vacancies by popularity or tailored to their preferences. The "For You" section displays vacancies relevant to the user, considering their activity and saved filters/vacancies.</p></Li>
<Li><h3>Extra Functionality - Messages

</h3><P>Recognizing the hectic schedules of both employees and employers, where emails may get lost in the shuffle, I've introduced a messaging feature that is consistently available on the website. This allows for quick and convenient communication directly within the platform. Employees can easily refer to the associated vacancy while engaging in discussions, ensuring that no important details are overlooked.</P></Li>
<Li><h3>Keywords</h3><p>Presenting key information prominently ensures that users can quickly grasp crucial details before deciding to delve further into the content. This approach enhances user experience by offering a snapshot of essential information, aiding in efficient decision-making and navigation.</p></Li>
<li><h3>Filters and Sorting:</h3><p>Specific Filters/Multiple Choices Allowed: Users can apply specific filters, allowing them to precisely find what they need. Multiple filters can be selected and will appear at the top for easy reference.

	<BR>Sorting Options: Users can sort vacancies by relevance (personalized for the user), newest, or most popular. The filters are designed based on user needs, such as flexibility and last-minute preferences.</p></li>
<li><h3>Displaying Chosen Filters/Undoing Decisions</h3><P>Selected filters are prominently displayed at the top once chosen, providing users with a clear overview of their selections. Users can easily close the filter section to see their choices. Additionally, there is an option to remove all filters at once, streamlining the user experience.</P></li>
<li><h3>Refining & Narrowing:</h3><p>The search strategy on the overview page involves refining and narrowing. Users often have specific criteria in mind, and this approach allows them to filter and view a smaller, more relevant set of vacancies.</p></li>
